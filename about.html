          <h1 class="page-title">A little about myself...</h1>
          <p>
            I am a student at the University of North Texas, currently pursuing a Bachelor of Arts degree in Information Technology. My passion for technology began in my STEM-based elementary school, whose computer hardware was housed in translucent cases. Since then, I have been on a mission to devour as much information as I can about computers and what makes them tick. I have since concerned myself with learning all aspects of the development lifecycle, including front-end and back-end development and databases. I am a firm believer that technology, if used properly, can advance our societies beyond our wildest dreams. With that in mind, I hope to influence the technological disrupt by integrating a bit of positivity into my work wherever I go.

            With all those hours spent sitting in front of a computer, it becomes necessary to exercise your body. I have enjoyed lifting weights since the age of 14, and have just recently begun my endeavour into the world of Brazilian Jiu Jitsu. All of this in an attempt to discipline myself, constantly searching for a greater challenge. Through these sports, I have certainly learned a thing or two about discipline. After all, nothing is more exciting than seeing the results of your hard work.

            The foremost of my other interests is automobiles and motorsports. This is a recent development, having never found much interest in the increasingly computerized vehicles that get us from point A to point B. However, I now see cars as an extension of my passion for technology in general and computers in particular. After all, cars, not unlike computers, are simply giant metal puzzles designed to achieve a purpose. Naturally, an affinity for motorsports followed. I enjoy watching Formula 1 and Formula E races, as well as other lesser-known divisions of race cars. Because of the rise in popularity of electric vehicles, I see new opportunities to use what I know in the realm of IT and CS to aid the development of safer, more efficient, and more exciting electric vehicles.
